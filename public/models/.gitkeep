# YOLOv5 Model Directory

This directory should contain the YOLOv5 ONNX model file:
- yolov5s.onnx

You can download the model from the application interface
or directly from the YOLOv5 GitHub releases:
https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v6.0/yolov5s.onnx

After downloading, place the file in this directory and refresh the application.

IMPORTANT TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you're having issues with model loading:
1. Ensure the model file is named exactly "yolov5s.onnx"
2. The file should be placed directly in this directory (public/models/)
3. The file should be a valid ONNX model (~14MB in size)
4. After placing the file, completely refresh your browser
